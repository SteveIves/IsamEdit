# IsamEdit

This project is a work in progress and is incomplete. It is a Synergy .NET Windows Forms
application that provides the ability to view various information that is defined in a
Synergy/DE repository, including the data in ISAM files that are referenced by the file
definitions in the repository. The intention is, as time permits, to implement a general
purpose ISAM file editor.
